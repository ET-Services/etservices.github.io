                    <ul>
                        <li><em>What's your take on the DBC / EDA experience?</em><br>From my experience of phase-0 so far, i feel very well supported and informed. <br>The ciriculum feels well put together and organic. Waffle board is great for keeping organised.</li>
                        <li><em>What are your impressions?</em><br>My cohort and coaches all seem to be very motivated and kind.</li>
                        <li><em>How do you see yourself engaging with this type of culture?</em><br>I see myself fitting in very well with the like minded and supportive people I have met so far. <br>I can't wait to start pair programming with them, andreally looking forward to getting stuck into some long intense days at DBC in Welli.</li>
                        <li><em>Have your expectations of EDA changed? If so, how?</em><br>I have reaslied that I am going to need to dedicate alot more time during the week to the phase-0 assignment and learning. <br>There is not enough time to get it all done over the weekends. <br>Pomodoro technique is going to be my new best friend I think.</li>
                        <li><em>Are you excited to participate in this kind of learning environment? Does it make you nervous?</em><br>Yes I am very excited about this learning environment. I have done the whole university thing, <br>and I eventually learned what I needed to know, but it too way took long, <br>and I feel that the EDA way of teaching and learning will be vastly more benificial for me. <br>Yes it does make me nervous, I am worried about quitting my job and going back to full-time study. <br>However I feel that EDA will give me the best shot at getting into a new field, <br> that I have the potential to excel at, but most importantly, enjoy myself</li>

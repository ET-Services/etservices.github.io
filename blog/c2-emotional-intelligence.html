                            <p>Emotional intelligence is about understanding the dynamics of ourselves, how we feel, how we think and lastly how we interact with those around us. Emotional competencies can be gained with practice. Self awareness, self-regulation, motivation, empathy and social skills are all qualities that have potential to be developed. The main idea that resonated with me was that emotional intelligence can be trained. To me this means that even though right now it may feel like this is something I am not good at, with time and dedication I can improve</p>
                            <p>The two minutes of mindfulness was not a wholly new concept to me, it reminded me of entering the "alpha state". This is something I learned about in my teens when I went on a course called "alpha dynamic" with my father and older brother back in Zimbabwe. Essentially it was about learning techniques to try and calm your brain, bringing you state of conciousness down from the beta brainwave levels, down into the more relaxed and receptive alpha brain wave levels. It did sound a bit like hocus pocus to me at that stage, but it has seemed to resonate with me that possibly Meng is talking about something similar. This entrigues me very much.</p>
                            <p>I found I was able to quieten down my mind, but it took almost the whole 2 minutes, hopefully with more practise I will improve.</p>

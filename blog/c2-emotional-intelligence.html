                <h3>Search Inside Yourself - Chapter 1</h3>
                <h4>Personal Learnings</h4>
                    <p>Emotional intelligence is about understanding the dynamics of ourselves, how we feel, how we think and lastly how we interact with those around us. Emotional competencies can be gained with practice.
                    The following are all qualities (emotional intelligences) that have potential to be developed:
                        <ol>
                            <li>Self awareness</li>
                            <li>Self-regulation</li>
                            <li>Motivation</li>
                            <li>Empathy</li>
                            <li>Social skills</li>
                        </ol>
                    </p>
                    <p>The first 3 are classed as "Intra-personal" and the last 2 are classed as "Inter-personal" skills.
                    </p>
                    <p>Meng talked about 3 main benefits of increasing emotional intelligence as being:
                        <ul>
                            <li>Stellar work performance (This can be further broken down into 6 qualities, with 4 out of 6 being emotional qualities:</li>
                                <ol>
                                    <li>Strong achievement drive</li>
                                    <li>Ability to influence</li>
                                    <li>Conceptual thinking</li>
                                    <li>Analytical ability</li>
                                    <li>Initiative in taking on challenges</li>
                                    <li>Self-confidence</li>
                                </ol>
                            <li>Outstanding leadership</li>
                            <li>The ability to create the conditions for happiness</li>
                        </ul>
                    </p>
                    <p>The main idea that resonated with me was that emotional intelligence can be trained. To me this means that even though right now it may feel like this is something I am not good at, with time and dedication I can improve.
                    </p>
                <h4>Two Minutes of Mindfulness</h4>
                    <p>The two minutes of mindfulness was not a wholly new concept to me, it reminded me of entering the "alpha state". This is something I learned about in my teens when I went on a course called "alpha dynamic" with my father and older brother back in Zimbabwe. Essentially it was about learning techniques to try and calm your brain, bringing your state of consciousness down from the beta brainwave levels, down into the more relaxed and receptive alpha brain wave levels. It did sound a bit like hocus pocus to me at the time, but it has seemed to resonate with me that possibly Meng is talking about something similar. This intrigues me very much.
                    </p>
                    <p>I found I was able to quieten down my mind, but it took almost the whole 2 minutes, hopefully with more practice I will improve.
                    </p>
                    <p>If you are interested in the Alpha course I talked about have a quick look at this link, <a href="http://www.alphadynamic.com.au/">Alpha Dynamic</a>
